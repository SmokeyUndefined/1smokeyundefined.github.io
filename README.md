	•	Data Logging: Data submitted by users is logged to a text file (LoggedData.txt).
	•	Webhook Integration: Optionally, data can be sent to a webhook endpoint for additional processing.

Technologies Used

	•	Flask: Python web framework used for backend development.
	•	HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend components for building the user interface and handling client-side logic.
	•	Requests Library: Used to send HTTP requests to the webhook endpoint.

File Structure

	•	index.html: HTML file containing the web form for data input.
	•	styles.css: CSS file for styling the web interface.
	•	script.js: JavaScript file containing client-side logic for handling form submission.
	•	server.py: Python script defining the Flask application and handling requests.
